function ASSERT(cond,msg)
%ASSERT - Similar to the C "assert" function
%
% ASSERT(cond,msg)
%
% cond should be an expression which is believed to be true.
% msg is a message describing the assertion.
%
% e.g. ASSERT(x>5 && x<20,'x is within the allowed limits')
%
% This should not be thought of as "normal" error handling.
% It is designed to help catch bugs in the code, and so the
% call stack is printed in the command window (so that it
% is not lost if the error is caught).
%
% Note: In R2007a and later, MATLAB has an "assert" function which is
% similar to this one but without the additional printing.  Use this
% one if your code contains lots of "catch" statements, which might
% otherwise hide an error thrown by the MATLAB "assert" function.
